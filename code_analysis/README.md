### Setting Up Your Environment

* https://github.com/aneagoie/smart-brain-api
* https://github.com/aneagoie/smart-brain
* Best practise it to Fork the repos
* Git clone to local machine
* Look at the package.json files
* npm install
* npm start to check if it works
* Try creating account
* If errors, open the Console in Web as well as Terminal
* Check if the error is on the Client side or the Server side
* Based on that, open relevant files
* In our case, it's a problem at the Backend
* Check what knex is from Github, npm etc
* Use Psequel for mac
```sh
brew services start postgresql
createdb 'smart-brain1'
```

### How To Analyze Code

* API first to look at the endpoints
  * Endpoints tell a lot about the App
* Look at the Folder structure and the README
* Next at index.js or the server.js
* Next in the Frontend, start off with index.js
* Start with the Big picture and get a general overview of everything
